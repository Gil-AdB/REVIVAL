# SESSION STATE — glass / editor / authoring campaign (updated 2026-07-11)

Read this when resuming. Branch **fog-wt**, nothing pushed. Previous campaign
(structural push): docs/posts/SESSION_STATE_2026-07-04_structural.md.
Range covered here: `1ca269d..7282f7a` (~60 commits, 2026-07-08..11).

## Verification protocol (THE gates — run before/after everything)

All runs headless from Runtime/: `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy`.

Traps:
- **greets flips ~1-in-12** to a random hash (unresolved kernel-internal
  nondeterminism, see Known Issues). Majority over 3+ runs decides; a single
  mismatch means rerun, not failure. Rate conclusions need the binomial
  (24-run gates for race claims — see memory `measurement-tool-traps`).
- **city cache**: `cache/city_envmap_cube.bin` is keyed on CITY.FLD bytes.
  After ANY CITY.FLD install, discard the first run (cache rebuild), then hash.
- Greets pin includes the USER'S UNCOMMITTED files (GREETS.FLD/MAT, momy
  textures, Piramid.lwo, Hull.lwo) — a clean checkout hashes differently.
  Those files are his: never stage, never overwrite, never `git add -A`.
- Editor page freshness: build tag in the panel header (currently b60/b61);
  bump it with every shell.html change or staleness is undiagnosable.
- **chase**: no bakes, no known nondeterminism (pinned srand, fine clock off
  in snapshots). Both pins above confirmed byte-identical over 3 runs each
  (2026-07-12, C0). **RECIPE-FRAGILE**: chase accumulates snapshot state across
  the timestamp-list loop, so a given t's hash depends on the WHOLE list —
  the pins are ONLY valid for the exact recipe `t=100,400,800,1200,1600` (and
  the cinematic `t=800,1600`). Running a subset/superset gives different (still
  deterministic) hashes — NOT a regression. Always gate with the exact list.
  Valid snapshot range **t=0..1698** (past 1699 the harness re-dumps the last
  rendered VPage). Regen from `Authoring/chase/` via `pin_scene.py
  --legacy-vlum` is byte-identical to the shipping FLD (delta=0, 747,511 B) —
  the pre-edit baseline for later authored chase stages.
- **Chase cone-tile "missing light on the rect" — FIXED (2026-07-30).** User
  saw rectangular seams in the lighthouse beams during chase (~t=211,
  cinematic). Root cause: the volumetric cone-pass tile cull
  (`Render_VolumetricCones`, `--spot_cone_cull`) computed each tile's far
  bound `zHiT` from `tileLights.zMax` = the farthest **opaque surface** only.
  `computeTileDepthBounds` excludes sky/untouched pixels from `zMax`, so a tile
  that MIXES surface + sky under-estimated its volumetric depth: a beam glowing
  in the tile's sky portion (rays that run to the fog cutoff) got clipped away
  there but kept in the adjacent pure-sky tile → a rectangular per-tile seam.
  Fix: `TileLights.hasSky` (set in `computeTileDepthBounds` when any pixel
  `zEnc==0`); the cone cull extends the far bound to the fog cutoff for
  has-sky tiles (tight opaque `zMax` retained for fully-covered tiles, so
  covered scenes keep the cull's perf). Result byte-== `--spot_cone_cull=0`
  ground truth at every pose; the chase pin move above IS this fix. Cone-pass
  cost +~1–2 ms at t≈211/700 (the previously-dropped correct beam work); still
  ~6–10 ms cheaper than no cull. city/fountain pins byte-unchanged (no
  mixed-sky cone tiles); render_gate 3/3 (conetest byte-identical).

## The big architecture decision (2026-07-11, user-set direction)

> **✅ DONE 2026-07-31 — the sidecar-elimination campaign is COMPLETE.** The
> `.MAT` reader (`MaterialImport_ApplySidecar` + `_ApplySceneDefaults` + helpers)
> is DELETED; every scene now calls `MaterialImport_ApplyRevMaps` (LWO RVSM) in
> its place. `Runtime/SCENES/GREETS.MAT` (last sidecar, data-empty) is DELETED —
> no scene ships sidecar data. The 7 (+1) `#k` split-collapse sites in
> `tools/editor_server.py` are DELETED; splits bake real surfaces via
> `payload.splits` geometric centroids. Save-completeness proven headlessly
> (byte-identical FLD idempotent regen + combined RVSF/RVSM/SMAN gain + split
> without `#k`). Gates: render_gate 3/3, city `37e62845`, fountain `51fff7cd`,
> momy close-cam `7d05a1be` byte-equal. Leftover WRITE-only, not-yet-FLD-backed
> (editor writes a `.MAT` nothing loads, warned): `obj:scale` (§1d FdsObjectScale
> unimplemented) and `normalFlip` (§1e RVSM write-back unimplemented). See
> docs/SIDECAR_MIGRATION_PLAN.md. Original direction preserved below.

**Sidecars are being eliminated.** Persistence belongs in the authoring
sources: per-surface → custom LWO SURF sub-chunks; per-light / per-object /
scene-level → LWS keywords; everything flows through tools/lwsread into the
FLD via **flag-bit + conditional payload** records (the proven extension
idiom — see next section). Crash (no sources yet) falls back to fldpatch
writing the same extended records. Sequencing constraint: writers first, user
re-saves greets once (his GREETS.MAT is the only record of the momy map
assignments), THEN the sidecar reader dies. In-flight work (see bottom)
already follows this; a full migration campaign (all SURF_SIDECAR_KEYS +
light:/obj:/scene: keys, editor Save rewrite, reader retirement) is the next
major batch.

## The FLD/LWS extension mechanism (use this for every new authored property)

Proven end-to-end by the volumetric-beam work (9172c5d):
1. LWS text keyword(s) per light/object/scene (e.g. `VolumetricLight 1`,
   `VolumetricLightIntensity 3.0`) parsed in tools/lwsread/LWSREAD.CPP
   (BOTH build variants: lwsread + lwsread_legacy — same source).
2. FLDSAVE.CPP writes a NEW flag bit + conditional payload after the record
   (bit-gated fields are the FLD's native extension shape; FLDs without the
   bit stay byte-identical — prove with a regen diff).
   **TRAP: bits 256/512/1024 of the light flags are OR-contaminated by
   ReadEndBehavior — bit 512 was NOT free. Headlight beams use bit 2048.
   Always check what ORs into a flag word before claiming a bit.**
3. Engine FLD loader (FDS/FLD/FLD_CONV.CPP) reads the conditional payload
   into an Omni/Material/Scene field (0-sentinel = unset → legacy default;
   GreetsMirror clones inherit via memcpy — sane by construction).
4. Editor write-back: tools/editor_server.py patches the LWS/LWO, regen via
   the scene's lwsread variant (legacy for chase/fountain/city — VLUM×100
   era), installs the FLD (backup to Runtime/SCENES/.backups/ first).

## What landed (grouped; commit msgs carry the detail)

### Authoring recovery — city is a full authoring scene
- Sources found IN-REPO (Original/dos-rev/.../CITY/): CITY1.LWS identified by
  light-set fingerprint; 17/20 objects byte-exact. b1/b3/b6 shipped higher-
  poly than any surviving LWO → recovered FROM the shipping FLD via
  tools/fld2lwo/ (byte-parity regen: CITY1.LWS → shipping CITY.FLD exact).
  Authoring/city/README.md has provenance + regen commands. (d60f5ab,
  cc6244e, 4f943a1)
- **Search lessons** (for the crash hunt + future archaeology): match by
  embedded SRFS surface-name sets, not filenames (the b3 slot holds a "b7"
  building); list ARJ archives (first sweep missed them); lwsread maps LWO
  points 1:1 to FLD verts — NO seam splitting, count-matching is valid.
- 46 authored headlight spotlights baked into CITY1.LWS (two per vehicle,
  parented, warm 255/235/185, 15°/30°), engine gained LightType-2 spot
  conversion + parented aim + flare-stamp skip. Code headlight schemes
  retired (default off, kept for A/B). (48d57e5, e4e34cf)
- Authored volumetric beams: per-light `VolumetricLightIntensity` gain
  (gain 3.0 shipped); retune = tools/add_city_beam_flags.py + regen. (9172c5d,
  1275dea)

### Determinism
- `srand(time(NULL))` → pinned seed (GENERAL.H). The Omni_Rand flare twinkle
  made every run unique — bakes-on frames all-distinct, bakes-off glass-band
  flips. (5f325d4)
- TBR transparent order: facing rank precomputed at insert (torn reads in the
  concurrent sort flipped front/back). (1e91306, fb3a302)
- Glass band scheduler: B1/B2 back/front sub-phases fixed the deterministic
  greets "face pop". (8539e8f → 8539e8)
- Scene clock sawtooth (user-visible "city camera jumps back"): rate was an
  EMA of instantaneous dTimer/dWall (Jensen-biased ~10% high) + hard snaps on
  hitches. Now ratio-of-EMAs + hitch-hold + continuous anchor. (2541c32)

### Rendering features (all default-off unless noted)
- Screen-space glass refraction stack (Mat_Refractive opt-in, per-material
  IOR, band scheduler w/ barriers) — editor ON by default. (f4d470a..)
- HDR: 250 lit-cap now HDR-gated in vec+transparent kernels too → luminosity
  >1 blooms (was scalar-only; editor edits were silently capped). LDR keeps
  the cap. NOTE: OuterVec still stores 8-bit — radiance >255 needs the scalar
  kernel on PreferOuterVec scenes. (f6ec404)
- Cone turbulence/swirl: world-space value noise + helical swirl in ALL
  three cone integration paths, SIMD (+3.2ms greets); user's tuned values in
  Runtime/PRESETS/greets-beams.flags. TRAP: reshaping the fmadd chain moves
  hashes by ulps even at neutral values — off path keeps the exact legacy
  expression. (ab9a9c1, 189eeec)
- Env live water (city): probe bake hides the water mesh, re-shades plane
  texels with the main-view procedural formula (Schlick + caustic cells);
  sample-time WaveSlope perturb animates. Bypasses the pristine cache when
  on (~4s init, 0 per-frame). Glints not baked (view-dependent). (5d28db7,
  0162d3b)
- fastfog dist-dim slice 4: sky dims at horizon + forward pixels dim
  (inert at default 0). (8acf8cd)

### Flags / presets
- `--flags-file=<path>` (nestable, comments, CLI-after-file wins) + unknown
  `--flag` WARNING (was silent — a typo'd `--fast-fog-blob` ran slab fog for
  weeks). Runtime/PRESETS/city-noir.flags = the user's city look, cinematic-
  based, measured byte-equivalent to his old 40-token line + blobs fix.
  (2482013)
- Per-surface migrations of former globals: waterProcedural (tri-state),
  envRefl (tri-state), envBakeRes (pow2, largest-wins on shared probes),
  RefractIor; scene-level sidecar defaults for boltFlash/fastFog bounds —
  NOTE: these sidecar forms are transitional; the LWS/LWO migration
  supersedes them. Precedence everywhere: per-surface > CLI/env > scene
  default > compile default. `SCRIPTS/<scene>.params` lines still override
  scene defaults (per-frame scripts yield only to explicit-set marks).

### Editor (browser, `make editor` → :8099/DEMO.html?editor&scene=<name>)
- Objects: FLD-tree hierarchy in all scenes (chunk-collapse `:cN`, engine
  helpers pooled in hidden "(engine)"; NAMED engine meshes with faces get
  visible entries — that's how the disco ball became reachable, plus its
  material needed MatLib linkage). Per-object scale knob (EditorScale on the
  Scale spline — pivots correctly, all instances; Tri_Possessed meshes are
  honestly inert). Focus = nearest-instance, in-context (2.5× radius).
- Lights: grouped by parent object, multi-select (ctrl/shift), group edit,
  click-to-select in viewport; authored city headlights appear grouped per
  vehicle.
- Surfaces: split w/ mirrors + #1/#2 naming (persistence via source-bake in
  flight — see below), map reset ✕ (restores authored incl. tangents), pack
  picker with FreePBR preview renders (98.7% coverage), procedural
  displacement generator (FBM), map-viz overlay, live smoothing, xpar PBR.
- Editor camera: instant (no momentum) in editor mode only.
- Boot race fixed: objects list retries (city published CurScene mid-init);
  console.warn when objects empty while surfaces exist.

## Known issues / deferred (honest list)

- **Greets mirror: cones leak through wall + doubled screen text
  (2026-07-30, user-reported, NOT yet investigated).** Repro:
  `FDS_GREETS_CAM="-6.75174379,3.12747574,-51.7348709,-0.0600466765,-0.148574546,-0.987076521"`
  t=3430, looking at a text-screen mirror panel. Two symptoms in one frame:
  (a) volumetric cone shafts/blooms visible INSIDE the mirror view where a
  wall should occlude them — suspicion set: the eb36c1f hasSky far-bound
  extension interacting with the mirror RTT bake's G-buffer, or the RTT
  bake's cone pass integrating behind its near plane; (b) the greets text
  ("kombat") rendered TWICE — one crisp, one ghosted/offset below — likely
  the half-silvered composite (text + reflection) meeting a second text
  source (base panel texture vs RTT/recursion path; the recursion-composite
  interaction is a known open item from MIRROR_RECURSION_PLAN slice 3).
  User's exact launch flags (2026-07-30): `FDS_POM_CONE=1 FDS_TEXTURE_FILTER=1
  FDS_POM_SPIKE=8 FDS_PARALLAX_STRENGTH=3 ./DEMO --shadows

  --cone-swirl=0.7 --env-brdf-analytic --sh-ambient --diffuse_energy
  --pbr_multiscatter` — note NO --mirror-recurse-depth (order-1/2 RTT path,
  not the recursion), and --deferred-quarter + --hdr are in play (the known
  wave-2/HDR checkerboard interaction family). **Does NOT repro on bare
  ./DEMO** (user-confirmed) — flag-gated; first bisect candidates when
  picked up: --shard-deferred, --hdr/--hdr-linear/--hdr-refl-gain=4,
  --deferred-quarter, --cone-fine-tiles. Parked deliberately
  ("finish the other threads first").

- **Greets ~1-in-12 flip**: kernel-internal nondeterminism, survives
  1-thread/noaslr/prescribble/pinned-seed with ALL kernel inputs
  hash-verified identical. Full evidence matrix + next probe (per-pixel term
  dump at amudim bake face 0 px 242,122) in memory `measurement-tool-traps`.
  Bounded impact: subtle pano slivers; frames deterministic with bakes off.
- Env-bake content varies run-to-run (same root cause family).
- The user's GREETS.MAT `momy#2|*` lines are DROPPED at load until he
  re-splits + re-saves in the editor (split-bake landed 6c6c972 — re-save now
  bakes momy2 into the LWO as a real surface; accepted, he regenerates).
- volumetric_unified (default-off Beer-Lambert pass) ignores per-light cone
  gain + turbulence.
- Mirror clones don't reflect a live object re-scale; tram return-leg beams
  face backwards (real shuttle behavior); fast_fog_blob_overlap clamps at
  1.5 (3×3×3 neighborhood); police strobe not in the authored lights.
- Legacy equirect env path (--no-env_cube) keeps static bake water.
- CITY.CPP line ~1575 unused `using std::min` (clang-tidy noise, off-limits
  era leftover — fine to fix opportunistically).

## Recently landed (was in-flight — verified + committed)

1. **Split persistence via SOURCE BAKE** (6c6c972): editor Save bakes runtime
   instance-splits into the LWO sources (lwopatch.split_surface reassigns
   non-primary polygon clusters to new real surfaces; bake_splits in
   editor_server.py matches live cluster centroids to source polygons). After
   reload the #k names are real authored surfaces. Crash/no-source scenes
   stay live-only. Recipe: re-split momy → Save → reload → momy/momy2 real
   surfaces with maps. Editor-flow verified by inspection (pieces + pins);
   NOT yet driven through a live browser split-save round trip.
2. **Scene-wide env defaults as LWS keywords** (6c6c972): FdsSceneEnvRefl /
   FdsSceneEnvBakeRes → bit-2048 conditional FLD payload → Scene fields →
   FramePrep. VERIFIED end-to-end (round-trip +8B; live read-back envRefl=1/
   res=512 → 133 probes at 512). Editor 'scene env defaults' row, tag b61.
3. **Crash sources + registry flip DONE** (470d7f1 + 6c6c972): vintage "END"
   laptop scene, lt_scr FLD-recovered via fld2lwo_crash.py, byte-parity regen
   (md5 4f8aac84…). crash promoted to authoring. EVERY scene is now
   source-authored — the fldpatch fallback in the sidecar-elimination plan is
   dead.
4. **Chase upgrade plan** (docs/CHASE_UPGRADE_PLAN.md): 612-line staged plan
   (blasters, hit particles, camera, movement, lighting + more) — planning
   only, awaiting user stage-selection before any implementation.

## Queued next (user-requested, 2026-07-11)

- **CHASE WATER DARK BAND — DONE (604fd43).** Ported soa-vertex 9902349; chase
  water now bright/uniform, no band (t1600 verified); chase pins re-baselined
  (table above); city/fountain byte-identical; render_gate PASS; wasm links.
  Original note kept for context:
  The "lower missing water layer" (horizontal seam, dark band below)
  is the documented `chase water dark band` bug, FIXED on ~/work/revival
  `feature/soa-vertex` commit **9902349**. Two defects: (1) InsertTransparentToTBR
  (FDS/FILLERS/FILLERS.CPP ~1796) computed the strip span from projected PY,
  garbage for the camera-STRADDLING water quad → water inserted only above the
  horizon, vanished below (the band = mirrored-mountain underlay). Fix: verts
  in front of near plane → insert into EVERY strip, sort by FAR surface.
  (2) water_procedural kernel composite darkens vs chase's black night-sky
  reflection → new flag `water_fresnel_composite` (default ON=city), chase
  factory sets it OFF, city re-pins ON. fog-wt CONFIRMED at the exact
  before-state (FILLERS.CPP:1807/1816 old PY code, DeferredSurfaceKernel.cpp:2525
  waterProcOn, no flag yet, CHASE.CPP:996-999 factory). Port all 5 files
  (FILLERS.CPP, DeferredSurfaceKernel.cpp, FeatureFlags.def, CHASE.CPP, CITY.CPP),
  verify chase water bright/no-band + city/fountain byte-identical (fixes city's
  bottom-strip band too, brighten-only).
- **CHASE SPOTS realign — NEEDS REDO** (user "not seeing the spotlights").
  CONFIRMED: L2.3 canyon spots don't visibly light the mountains with the new
  trail-follow camera (verified at t=1200 — moonlit grey, no warm/cool). A
  realign agent (aa4f40da) DIED at the session limit mid-work; its uncommitted
  variant-a checkpoint (surface-wash) did NOT make them visible (still grey) and
  was DISCARDED (reverted to HEAD). Redo needs: re-aim at the mountains the new
  camera frames (t≈1100-1300), BOOST intensity/contrast so warm/cool reads
  against the moon, and try visible VolumetricLight beams (bit-2048; L2.3 dropped
  them as near-invisible — tighter cones + higher gain, esp. under cinematic
  fog). Deliver beams-vs-no-beams A/B. Chase-only (CHASE.LWS + regen).
- **CHASE COMBAT — LANDED, all default-OFF, gated, deterministic, inert**
  (blasters agent a3471e22, resumed repeatedly): 22963db denser barrage
  t≈340-1700 · ff821a2 B2 impact-spark particles · 1e55078 C1 `chase_cam_fx`
  camera shake + FOV punch on hits · ecc3359 chase-scale bolt-light reach
  (blaster_light_range 90, intensity 260, via setDefault in createChaseScene) ·
  2d33373 B2 near-miss water-splash columns (a `water` aim mode in the fire
  table — tracers punch the sea, vertical spray). Combat CODE side is now
  feature-complete.
  All pure-t (snapshot-safe), OFF byte-identical (chase pins unchanged
  9cc80e9e…), city/fountain unmoved. Flags: chase_blasters, chase_spark_size
  (0.00005), chase_spark_bright (255), chase_cam_fx, chase_cam_shake_gain
  (0.04), chase_cam_fov_kick (5). Awaiting user look-approval before default-on.
  **KEY readability finding (agent):** combat reads subtle because ships are
  small in frame + Ship1's oversized L1 engine flare washes nearby sparks —
  the real levers are the FLARE TAME + closer combat FRAMING, not the bolts.
  Deferred combat follow-ups: water-splash columns (need bolt↔water-plane
  intersect), act-3 return-fire + venting hit, FdsMuzzle keyword, bloom-threshold
  tune for bolt cores. NOTE: this agent kept getting resumed and committing
  autonomously — verify+reconcile each time; consider routing chase work through
  one path.
- **EDITOR STABILITY — DONE** (30c2931 texture dedup by path + 339c65a wasm
  INITIAL_MEMORY 128→512MB). Fixes material-reuse + the unaligned-atomic import
  crash. Native pins byte-identical; user confirms in-browser (make editor →
  import same map on 2 surfaces = 1 decode + [reuse]; roughness import = no crash).
- **EDITOR STABILITY (2 issues, user 2026-07-14; blocked on build = blasters
  agent finishing):**
  (a) `unaligned memory access` crash on texture import (e.g. roughness on
  R_leg1.lwo::hull) — same trap class as the audio crash: a wasm ATOMIC op on
  a misaligned address, under the editor's `-pthread + ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH`
  build when an import allocation triggers a HEAP GROW while threadpool workers
  are live (emscripten#17816/#23806, already noted in DEMO/CMakeLists.txt).
  INITIAL_MEMORY=128MB → grows on every import. Mitigations: raise
  INITIAL_MEMORY so typical imports don't grow; and/or run the material apply
  single-threaded so no worker is mid-atomic during a grow.
  (b) **Material/texture NOT reused across objects** — same material re-decoded
  + re-allocated per object instead of sharing one loaded Texture. Wasteful AND
  a direct cause of (a): N copies = N allocs = more grow events = more crashes.
  Fix: a texture dedup cache keyed by source path in the import path (the code
  `new Texture` + re-decodes each ApplyMapFile). Do this FIRST — highest value,
  verifiable, and it cuts the crash rate. Distinct from the metallic-import OOM
  (8d936e0, already fixed).

- **Editor UX batch** — DONE (2026-07-12, d5a6ae9, tag b66): solid
  metallic/roughness generators (the mech-metallic recipe), Save "what
  changed" receipt, persistent status bar, canvas-fits-beside-panel (letterbox
  via CSS; fill=engine-resize deferred), settings find/category-groups/
  changed-only. shell.html-only; native/pins untouched.
- **Chase upgrade** — plan in docs/CHASE_UPGRADE_PLAN.md. Provenance: chase is
  a scene BUILT-BUT-CUT in 1998 (lack of tuning time), hand-corrected in the
  revival — **NO sacred 1998 baseline; free to retune for look** (user,
  2026-07-12). **C0 + S0 + L1 landed (2026-07-12, fog-wt).**
  L1 (4a54af5/3bb68ea/4cb7513): flare sanity + SceneCorrections retirement +
  sky gradient. New identifiers: LWS `FdsFlareScale` → light-bit **4096**
  (Light_FlareScale) → Omni::FlareScale; LWS `ZenithColor/SkyColor/
  GroundColor/NadirColor` → scene-header bit **4096** (Scene_SkyColors, on
  AmbientIntensity EndBehavior — distinct word from the light bit) →
  Scene::Sky*; flags `chase_legacy_omni_hack` (default OFF, retired hack
  escape-hatch), `sky_gradient` (default OFF — the CANDIDATE, generic: would
  paint city/crash void sky too). Chase default pin RE-BASELINED (table above).
  Sky is opt-in pending look-approval + a default flip / chase preset (can't
  use SCRIPTS/chase.params — protected). Moon light is degenerate (IRange=0,
  no contribution) — preserved from the hack, future tuning target.
  Authoring/chase/README.md now STALE ("byte-parity 1998" no longer true) —
  small doc-pass TODO. C0 (b72e7a9): chase gate pins (RECIPE-FRAGILE) +
  stale-comment fix. S0 (30a9c2e):
  `tools/build_beatmap.py` + `Authoring/chase/chase.beatmap` (placement-
  agnostic — chase has NO track slot yet, arbitrary song+start-order
  scaffolding), `DEMO/ChaseEvents.{h,cpp}` (beat-map + event-table loader +
  pure-`t` `Events_ActiveAt` — the §8.B contract), flag `chase_event_test`
  (default off) + RunChaseSnapshot determinism proof.
- **`Modplayer_GetPosition` — LANDED on master** (2026-07-12): decision (b),
  decoupled from the refactor migration. Parent ce615c2 bumps submodule
  e6429cf → **9d2a1ca** + adds the header decl. Pure lock-free FFI accessor
  over the EXISTING display triple-buffer (`SongState::get_position` reads the
  `TripleBuffer<PlayData>` the display path already publishes — NO new atomics,
  per the user's correction). Fields: order/row/tickInRow + songTick =
  **milliseconds-since-start** (PlayData has no u64 tick; ms is the monotonic
  clock; add total_samples to PlayData if sample-exact ever needed). **Getter
  requires `Modplayer_SetDisplay(handle,true)`** — the demo currently sets it
  FALSE (REV.CPP:1077/1619) for perf, so a sync consumer must re-enable it.
  Verified monotonic under playback; dead-stripped from DEMO (0 refs → pins
  unchanged); both builds link.
  **ACTION NEEDED FROM USER: merge modplayer PR #20**
  (github.com/Gil-AdB/modplayer/pull/20 — direct push to origin/master was
  branch-protected, so 9d2a1ca is on branch `feat/modplayer-getposition`). If
  it SQUASH-merges to a new SHA, re-bump the parent pointer to the merged
  commit (noted in ce615c2's message).
- **DEFERRED: modplayer `feat/s3m-refactor` adoption** — a more accurate S3M
  player, but it PREDATES the embedder FFI (verified: has Create/Start/
  SetOrder; MISSING SetDisplay/FillBuffer/FillBufferPlanar + the external-audio
  cargo feature). Adopting = a full re-port of the embedder audio layer onto
  the refactored core, its own focused task. Pick up when S3M playback
  accuracy becomes the priority.
- **Sidecar-elimination migration** (the big one): now that all scenes are
  source-authored and the scene-env keywords proved the pattern, migrate the
  remaining SURF_SIDECAR_KEYS + light:/obj:/scene: keys to LWO SURF
  sub-chunks / LWS keywords → FLD payloads, rewrite editor Save, retire the
  sidecar reader (writers first; user re-saves greets once; then reader dies).
  **INCLUDES: rip out the `#k` split-marker scaffolding** (user-confirmed
  2026-07-11). `#k` is vestigial — it exists only because the OLD sidecar/
  live-only-split path couldn't bake, so a `momy#2` edit had to COLLAPSE back
  to the real `momy` surface (the 7 `re.sub(r"(#\d+)+$","")` sites in
  editor_server.py: lines ~146/271/287/389/424/761/932/958). Two facts make
  it dead once sidecars go: (1) splits now BAKE into the LWO → parts are real
  surfaces, nothing transient to collapse; (2) the shell sends explicit
  `payload.splits` with per-part world centroids and bake_splits matches
  parts GEOMETRICALLY, never by parsing `#k` from the name. So in the
  migration those collapse sites get DELETED (not guarded), and a split
  becomes "make a real surface, reassign polygons, any plain name". Do NOT
  add existence-aware-collapse or build further on `#k`. Post-migration the
  only transient label needed is cosmetic (the live window between "split"
  and "Save") — nothing functional keys off it. That also dissolves the
  momy#1/#2-vs-momy2 naming question (currently unresolved, left as-is on
  purpose): naming becomes a free cosmetic choice, not a load-bearing
  convention. Engine side is already clean — Editor_BaseSurfName strips only
  ::mirUV, never `#`.

## Where the rest of the knowledge lives

- Cross-session traps + pins history: memory `measurement-tool-traps`
  (~/.claude/.../memory/) — race-hunt methodology, instrument pitfalls,
  binomial rule, pin re-pin log with justifications.
- Authoring provenance: Authoring/city/README.md (parity math, regen).
- Pipeline wiring: docs/GRAPHICS_PIPELINE.md, docs/ENGINE.md (pre-campaign
  but still accurate for the core).
- Old shipping FLDs: Runtime/SCENES/.backups/ + git history (last commit
  carrying each noted in the promotion commit messages).
